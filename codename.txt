From the cloud You speak
What was failed now is seen
Jesus the image of
The invisible God
Divinity confirmed
In the transfigured word
A kingdom once concealed
On the earth now revealed

Holy is the lord revealed before my eyes 
And my burning heart can scarcely take it in 
As I behold your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
Is Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah my King

Lead my longing heart
To the high ground, to the clear view
Ending nor' I'll be there
Beholding You

Holy is the lord revealed before my eyes 
And my burning heart can scarcely take it in 
As I behold your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
Is Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah my King

Now I know
I have seen
The glory that cannot be unseen
I am changed
Changing still
As I look upon the Lord and believe

Holy is the lord revealed before my eyes 
And my burning heart can scarcely take it in 
As I behold your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
Is Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah my King
